# Cake Tanks

Back in the 90's, I used to play a game on the Macintosh called [Bolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolo_(1987_video_game)). It was probably the first networked game I played, but I didn't often have multiple computers to play it on. Occasionally my older brother would borrow a machine from school for some project or other, and we could AppleTalk it with our family's Macintosh Classic II, and play two at a time.

The gist of the game is that you are driving a tank around trying to control bases and pillboxes. You could collect resources and modify the map. Any pillboxes you claimed would shoot at opponents, and you could lay mines that would appear to enemies just before they ran over them.

This is a simple attempt to get some practice at writing a networked multi-player game, using nostalgia as an excuse.

The original game got its name from the ["Hindi word for communication"](https://web.archive.org/web/20070518233700/http://bishop.mc.duke.edu/bolo/guides/stuartfaq.html). I don't speak Hindi, but I do speak Portuguese, and "bolo" is the word for "cake".
